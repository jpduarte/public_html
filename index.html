    <p> I received my B.Sc.(2010) and M.Sc.(2012) degrees from the Department of Electrical Engineering, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST), Daejeon, Korea, in 2010 and 2012 respectively. There, I had the pleasure to work with professor Yang-Kyu Choi and his <a href="http://nobelab.kaist.ac.kr/">Nobelab</a> group. I am actually born and raised in Chile, indeed, after my Master in South Korea, I hold positions as a lecturer at Universidad Tecnica Federico Santa Maria, Valparaiso, Chile, in 2012, in the Department of Electronic Engineering and the Department of Physics, respectively. I am currently working toward my PhD. degree in the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences at the University of California, Berkeley, where I am part of <a href="http://bsim.berkeley.edu/">BSIM Group</a>. During 2016, I have been a Graduate Student Instructor for the course "EE16B: Designing Information Devices and Systems II" for <a href="https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~ee16b/sp16/">spring</a> and <a href="https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~ee16b/fa16/">fall</a> semesters.  </p>

    <p>In BSIM group, I work with professor Chenming-Hu, where we develop physics-based, accurate, scalable, robust, and predictive MOSFET SPICE models for circuit simulation and CMOS technology development. Our models are used by major semiconductor manufacturers and circuit designers. I also collaborate with professor Sayeef Salahuddin in the development of models for Negative-Capacitance FETs. </p>

    <p> During my time as a researcher, I have been the author or coauthor of more than 50 papers related to nanoscale semiconductor devices and bio-sensors. In 2013, I received the Best Student Paper Award at the 2013 International Conference on Simulation of Semiconductor Processes and Devices (SISPAD) for the paper "Unified FinFET Compact Model: Modelling Trapezoidal Triple-Gate FinFETs". My paper entitled "Compact Models of Negative-Capacitance FinFETs: lumped and distributed charge models" was accepted into IEDM and presented on December 7th at San Francisco. You can also find a list of my publications <a href="http://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=4k_34lYAAAAJ">here</a>. </p>


    <p> During 2017, I lectured a DeCal course called <a href="http://github.com/jpduarteeecs/hardwaremakers">Hardware Makers</a></li>. The ultimate purpose of the course was to have fun with hardware! Students learned how to create hardware with wifi/bluetooth connections of several prototyping boards, sensors, actuators, and additional electronics components. </p>

    <p> In my free time, I enjoy riding bikes around California and Chile, you can follow my cycling activities in <a href="https://www.strava.com/athletes/10239173">strava</a>. I am part of <a href="https://www.facebook.com/CalCycling/">Cal Cycling</a>, where I race for the category A team. In May 2016, our team got the 5th place in Collegiate Nationals Time Trial Race. In April 2017 I was 16th in the general omnium of Cycling Collegiate Nationals at Grand Junction, Colorado. I am very concerned about the amount of trash in the beautiful routes of California and the wold in general, so with some friends we have founded the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/Cyclists-Green-Initiative-1244196655661077/?fref=ts">Cyclists Green Initiative</a>. Our main goal is to pick up a piece of trash for each cycling ride. It is incredible the amount of trash that we have collected in such a short time, if you want to join us, just start picking up some trash while biking!  </p>

    <p> In my time out of California, I am usually at Chile or Indonesia, where I use most of the time to share with my family and to get some world class waves while surfing as you can see in the following picture :). </p>
